# Project Name
> Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace specializing in a variety of loans for urban customers, faces a critical challenge in managing its loan approval process. The company must make prudent decisions to minimize financial losses, mainly from loans given to "risky" applicants.

These financial losses, known as credit losses, occur when borrowers fail to repay or default on their loans. Borrowers who default, or are "charged-off," cause the most significant losses to the company.

The primary objective of this exercise is to help Lending Club reduce credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

1. Identifying applicants likely to repay their loans is crucial, as they generate profits for the company through interest payments. Rejecting such applicants results in lost potential business.
2. Conversely, approving loans for applicants likely to default can lead to substantial financial losses for the company.

## General Information
The goal is to identify applicants at risk of defaulting on loans, reducing credit losses. This case study uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset to achieve this.

Lending Club aims to understand the key indicators of loan default. This insight will aid in portfolio management and risk assessment.

The exercise has two main scenarios:
1. Identifying reliable applicants to maximize profits through interest payments and avoid losing potential business.
2. Avoiding approval of high-risk applicants to prevent significant financial losses.



## Conclusions
Grades B, C, and D: Implement stricter risk assessment and underwriting criteria, as these grades contribute most to "Charged Off" loans.

Subgrades B3, B4, B5: Apply additional risk mitigation measures or offer lower loan amounts due to higher default likelihood.

Term Length: Evaluate and potentially limit 60-month loans to reduce default risk.

Experience: Use a comprehensive credit scoring system; applicants with 10+ years of experience are still likely to default.

Growth Trend: Maintain competitive edge amid market growth from 2007 to 2011, ensuring robust risk management.

Seasonal Trends: Anticipate increased demand in December and Q4, ensuring efficient processing.

Debt Consolidation: Carefully evaluate debt consolidation applicants; adjust rates or offer financial counseling.

Housing Status: Consider housing stability in underwriting; renters and mortgaged applicants are more likely to default.

Verification Process: Review and improve verification, as verified applicants have higher default rates.

Geographic Risk: Adjust strategies for high-risk states like CA, FL, and NY.

High Loan Amounts: Conduct thorough assessments for loans $15,000+ and consider capping amounts for high-risk applicants.

DTI and Interest Rates: Adjust rates based on DTI ratios; high DTI and 13%-17% interest rates are linked to defaults.

Low Annual Income: Offer financial education and set loan caps for applicants with incomes below $40,000 to ensure affordability.
